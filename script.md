# Exciting Introduction to SSH Commander with RTX Integration: A Game-Changer for Local AI on Windows!

## Welcome, Tech Enthusiasts!

Hello, **Ray Bernard** here, and I'm thrilled to walk you through a groundbreaking demonstration of the **SSH Commander**, now supercharged with **GeForce RTX** integration. Imagine harnessing the power of **ChatGPT with RTX** as your foundational AI platform, all from the comfort of your Windows machine. That's exactly what we're diving into today!

## What's on the Agenda?

- **Revolutionary Integration**: We're merging the latest in AI, utilizing a hefty **A4060 GPU with 8GB of VRAM**, and the **Minstrel 7B** language model. The result? A local AI powerhouse using **Tensortt LLM** for unparalleled efficiency, capability and performance.

- **The SSH Commander with RTX**: This isn't just any program; it's your gateway to effortlessly generating and deploying SSH commands. The AI does the heavy lifting, crafting commands for you to review and execute. It's simplicity and efficiency at its finest.

- **OpenAI Compatible API**: We have included a  compatible OPenAPI apli.  The gui is not build yet.  You are welcome  do use it as it is promising seamless integration for developers keen on customization. Stay tuned for a future video detailing how to set this up yourself! In short it just requires you to uncomment two lines from the app_launch.bat.  We includes a test_app.py client for connecting , testing and running the OpenAI compatilbe api. 


# Getting Started

1. **Launching the App**: Find the **SSH Commander** icon within the application. Feel free to drag it onto your desktop for easy access. Upon launching, a terminal window pops upâ€”your go-to for troubleshooting or simply peeking behind the curtain.

2. **Engage with the AI**: Whether you're chatting directly, pulling information from a URL, or navigating through a dataset, the SSH Commander with RTX is ready to assist. Need to configure a network, run playbooks, or set up loopback addresses? Just ask, and watch as precise commands are served up for your SSH adventures.

## Real-World Application

- **Practical Configuration**: Follow along as we configure network nodes, manage SSH sessions, and seamlessly integrate with Nvidia Air for secure connections. The beauty of this tool lies in its ability to edit, delete, or rerun commands, ensuring a tailored and error-free setup.

- **Documentation Made Easy**: Every step of your configuration can be downloaded in a markdown file, making documentation a breeze. Add, edit, or revise to keep your records up-to-date and accessible.

## Future Promises

An **API server** is on the horizon, aiming to further streamline your programming experience. While it's currently hidden, the next release will unveil its full potential.

## Wrapping Up

This demonstration barely scratches the surface of what's possible with the SSH Commander and RTX integration. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, the ease of use, efficiency, and power at your fingertips is unparalleled.

Thank you for joining me, **Ray Bernard**, on this exciting journey. The future of local AI on Windows is here, and it's more accessible than ever. Stay tuned for more updates, and happy coding!
